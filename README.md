## Budget Buddy
* **Purpose of the app:** 
   This app was created to encourage users to keep track of their expenses while facilitating the view of the transactions for them. 
* **How to use:**
   Users must register in order to be able to use our app. After registering, the user has the option to enter a transaction, view all transactions by category and time or go to user settings and set a budget for each category. This budget will take into consideration any transactions added to the category on the main page. Hence why the total shown in the home page will change accordingly. 
* **Features on the app:**
    As said before, the budget implementation is optional and therefore viewed as a feature. Our group also included the posibility of deleting the account, changing the budget amount and renewing the password.
